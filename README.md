# Mall Customer Clustering Project
This repository contains a project that focuses on clustering mall customers using machine learning clustering models. The project leverages a dataset with the following column names:

CustomerID
Genre
Age
Annual Income (k$)
Spending Score (1-100)

In this README file, we'll provide an overview of the project

# Overview
The primary goal of this project is to cluster mall customers into different groups based on their characteristics, such as age, annual income, and spending score. Clustering helps businesses gain insights into customer segments, allowing for more targeted marketing and service strategies.

# Data
The dataset for this project is typically provided in CSV format. Ensure that the dataset contains the columns mentioned earlier for the project to work as expected. You may also need to preprocess the data if it's in a different format or if you have specific data cleaning and transformation requirements.
